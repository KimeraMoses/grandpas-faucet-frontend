## Client's Requirements
The tasks are as follows:

1. Responsive and cross-browser page background and footer
2. Login by Button to connect to Metamask Wallet via Polygon(matic.js) library
3. OTP form and verification if member
4. Redirection link to https://whiteboardcrypto.com/ after login if not a member
5. FAQs accordion
6. Localization (English only)
7. Form
 - Amount Input field + Captcha
 - "Select with dummy data (will be loaded from DB)
  Options: MATIC, FTM, ETH, AVAX, ONE, ETH, NEAR, CELO, BNB, FTM"

8. Transaction Status / Blacklisted user components
9. Display last 5 successful transactions below input section just before FAQ accordion(updated every second).
10. Connect frontend to backend
10. Testing and Debugging
11. Documentation (Readme)

After the first design, other requirements recieved were
Also please rename the routes:
- otp-confirm to confirm-otp
- whiteboard to sign-up 
- meta-mask to connect-metamask
Also remove the Captcha from the confirm page as it is only accessible to logged in users so they must have verified the OTP.
Lastly, please redirect all unknown pages to the sign-in page.
Remember to create a base module for API connections to the backend that will get credentials from a .env file.
It could be of the form
apiRequest(method, url, payload) {
try {
// adios, request, fetch or anything you use here.
}
catch(error){
// format general errors from API here for localization 
}
}



## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
